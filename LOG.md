6.2

Edited the README file with a short description and some ideas; not finalized yet - Ling

Reformated the README file, added Main file; currently only a circle that tracks mouse movements - Fawn


6.3

Ideas for project: speed booster, point multiplier, pearl (extra points),  invulnerability, fishfood?, poisoned food (handicap - makes you swim in the reverse direction or slows you down),
lives & life boosters, combo bar ("Frenzy!" meter that will give double the points when filled up), a bar to keep track of the largest fish that can be eaten, fishing hook? & jellyfish to avoid

IF WE HAVE TIME: implement new mode "TIME ATTACK", or include sound?

Enemy variables: speed, size, color, frequency, new levels, point value, food value (how much larger does this make the fish?)

use linkedlist to keep track of current fish on screen (easier to add and/or remove) - Ling

Made Player class seperate, fixed values to more appropriate numbers for our purposes - Fawn
